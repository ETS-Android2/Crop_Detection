<h2> Android application for detection of crop by capturing an image </h2>

<p style="font-size:14px;">
  This was my very first machine learning project. I worked on this project during the "Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 
  2020 competition along with a team of 6 people. The dataset for this project was not available on the internet, so we had to obtain it using 
  various web scraping tools such as bing image downloader. We also manually downloaded some images. <br><br> 
  
  Then we worked to develop a machine 
  learning model with tensorflow keras library. The accuracy obtained for this dataset was 91% on validation dataset and 96% on the training 
  dataset. <br><br> 
  
  After creating the model, we worked on the android application. For this we used various libraries like tflite and picaso. During 
  this project I learned playing with permissions in android. I encountered some errors and bugs but over the time I was able to fix them.The 
  project is uploaded on github as well.
